# Dice-Game-Web
Dice game program that i have developed as a suggestion in my bootcamp:
This was build in JavaScript.
Every time you refresh the webpage two new variables will be assigned that will determine a number value from 1 to 6 that define the dice roll of two players. If the first or the second player wins the if statement will change the h1 innerHTML through JS DOM informing which player won. If both dices roll the same number value, the if statement will change the h1 to inform it's a draw.
